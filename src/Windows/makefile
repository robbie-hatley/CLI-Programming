# Set collection name:
COLLECTION := Windows

# Set the exe directory so that gcc & g++ know where to write to:
EXSUFF := /Windows

# Set source vpath directories so that make can find the c and cpp files for this collection:
vpath %.c   /rhe/src/Windows
vpath %.cpp /rhe/src/Windows

# ALL        = list of all *.exe files corresponding to the *.c and *.cpp files in current directory.
# C_PROGRAMS = list of all *.exe files corresponding to the *.c           files in current directory.
# X_PROGRAMS = list of all *.exe files corresponding to the         *.cpp files in current directory.
ALL        = $(shell make-all-list.pl)
C_PROGRAMS = $(shell make-c-list.pl)
X_PROGRAMS = $(shell make-x-list.pl)
