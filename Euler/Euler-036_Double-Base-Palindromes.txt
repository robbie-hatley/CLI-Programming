Euler Project Problem 36: Double Base Palindromes

585[base 10 (decimal)] = 1001001001[base 2 (binary)]
is palindromic in both bases.

Find the sum of all numbers, less than one million, 
which are palindromic in base 10 and in base 2.

(Please note that the palindromic number, in either 
base, may not include leading zeros.)
