PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

Task 2: Merge Account
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
You are given an array of accounts i.e. name with list of email addresses. Write a script to merge the accounts where
possible. The accounts can only be merged if they have at least one email address in common.
Example 1: Input:  [['A', 'a1@a.com', 'a2@a.com'] , ['B', 'b1@b.com'] , ['A', 'a3@a.com', 'a1@a.com']]
           Output: [['A', 'a1@a.com', 'a2@a.com', 'a3@a.com'], ['B', 'b1@b.com']]
Example 2: Input:  [['A', 'a1@a.com', 'a2@a.com'], ['B', 'b1@b.com'], ['A', 'a3@a.com'], ['B', 'b2@b.com', 'b1@b.com']]
           Output: [['A', 'a1@a.com', 'a2@a.com'], ['A', 'a3@a.com'], ['B', 'b1@b.com', 'b2@b.com']]

INPUT/OUTPUT NOTES:

Input is via built-in array of arrays of arrays, or by @ARGV. If using @ARGV, input should be a single argument
consisting of an array of arrays of arrays, in proper Perl syntax, with each email address surrounded by 'single quotes'
and with the entire array of arrays of arrays surrounded by "double quotes", like so:
"([['麦','se@gop.com','麦藁@雪.com'],['T','2@38.com'],['藁','麦藁@雪.com','b@a.com']],[['B','f@g.com'],['S','h@i.com']])"

Output is to STDOUT and will be each "raw" set of input arrays, followed by the "merged" set.
