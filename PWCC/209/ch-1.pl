PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

Task 1: Special Bit Characters
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
You are given an array of binary bits that ends with 0. Valid sequences in the bit string are:
[0] -decodes-to-> "a"
[1, 0] -> "b"
[1, 1] -> "c"
Write a script to print 1 if the last character is an “a”, otherwise print 0.
Example 1:   Input: @bits = (1, 0, 0)      Output: 1
Example 2:   Input: @bits = (1, 1, 1, 0)   Output: 0

INPUT/OUTPUT NOTES:

Input is via built-in array of arrays or by @ARGV. If using @ARGV, input should be a single argument consisting of an
array of arrays, in proper Perl syntax, surrounded by 'single quotes', like so: '([1,0,0,1,1],[1,1,0,1,0])'

Output is to STDOUT and will be each input array, its decoding, and 1-or-0 (depending on whether-or-not the last
character of the decoding is 'a').
