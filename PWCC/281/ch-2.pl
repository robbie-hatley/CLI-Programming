PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
Task 281-2: Knightâ€™s Move
Submitted by: Peter Campbell Smith
Write a script which calculates the minimum number of moves for
a knight to get from one square to another on a chess board,
given the start and end locations in algebraic notation.

Example 1:
Input: ['g2', 'a8']
Ouput: 4
Path:  g2 -> e3 -> d5 -> c7 -> a8

Example 2:
Input: ['g2', 'h2']
Ouput: 3
Path:  g2 -> e3 -> f1 -> h2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM NOTES:
I suppose I could use recursion for this and use recursion depth as "hops" counter, but that would involve
accessing global variables from within functions (which seems nasty) and a deep stack (which I don't like).
So I'll use a variant of Breadth-First Search. I'll make a hash "%Squares" of all 64 squares, with their keys
being their algebraic notations and their values being [visited, hops] all initialized to [0,inf] except for
start which is [0,0]. I'll make a variable "$current" to keep track of "current hops from start". I'll then
process the itinerary for so long as its not empty by doing the following:
   1. Shift left-most "@itinerary" square into "$current".
   2. Set current as "visited".
   5. Get octopus of squares which can be visited next.
   6. For each unvisited arm of octopus, set hops current+1 and push onto right end of "@itinerary".
After the queue empties, $squares{$end}->[1] should contain "minimum hops to get from start to end".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IO NOTES:
Input is via either built-in variables or via @ARGV. If using @ARGV, provide one argument which must be a
single-quoted array of arrays of two double-quoted algebraic chess notations, in proper Perl syntax, like so:
./ch-2.pl '(["a1","a8"],["c2","e7"],["c3","f6"],["a1","g8"],["a1","h8"])'

Output is to STDOUT and will be each input followed by the corresponding output.

   # We can't possibly get here. But if we do, inform user that something bizarre has happened and die:
