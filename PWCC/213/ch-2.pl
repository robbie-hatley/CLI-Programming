PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

Task 2: Shortest Route
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
You are given a list of bidirectional routes defining a network of nodes, as well as 
source and destination node numbers. Write a script to find the route from source to
destination that passes through fewest nodes, or print -1 of no such route exists.

Example 1:
Inputs: @routes = ([1,2,6], [5,6,7])
        $source = 1
        $destination = 7
Output: (1,2,6,7)
Source (1) is part of route [1,2,6] so the journey looks like 1 -> 2 -> 6
then jump to route [5,6,7] and takes the route 6 -> 7.
So the final route is (1,2,6,7)

Example 2:
Inputs: @routes = ([1,2,3], [4,5,6])
        $source = 2
        $destination = 5
Output: -1
(No route is possible.)

Example 3:
Inputs: @routes = ([1,2,3], [4,5,6], [3,8,9], [7,8])
        $source = 1
        $destination = 7
Output: (1,2,3,8,7)
Source (1) is part of route [1,2,3] so the journey looks like 1 -> 2 -> 3
then jump to route [3,8,9] and takes the route 3 -> 8
then jump to route [7,8] and takes the route 8 -> 7
So the final route is (1,2,3,8,7)

PROBLEM NOTES:


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INPUT / OUTPUT NOTES:

Input is via either built-in variables or via @ARGV. If using @ARGV, provide one argument
which must be a 'single-quoted' array of arrays in correct Perl syntax, with each array
consisting of source, followed by destination, followed by a sequence of arrays of 
integers representing various routes, like so:
./ch-2.pl '([4, -34, [5, -37, 4], [-3, 2, 5], [2, 6, -34]], [1, 5, [1,3,7], [5,6,7]])'

Output is to STDOUT and will consist of the inputs followed by the shortest route of any,
or -1 of no route exists from source to destination.
