That "goldfish" they talked about isn't a goldfish, it's a different species of carp. It's a hybrid of koi and leather carp. Goldfish get big but nowhere near that big.

1:10
everybody in this chat deserves to be
1:12
feels like when I was in Middle School I
1:14
wanted to be an artist slw writer but I
1:16
felt really self-conscious about my own
1:18
capabilities so I used to trace art and
1:20
copy other people's fanfic and repost it
1:23
on other sites that's actually a big
1:24
[ __ ] controversy in AO3 communities
1:26
I'll tell you I stopped doing it years
1:27
ago when the fanfic writer mentioned it
1:29
got scared and never did it again bro
1:32
you got you got caught you got caught
1:33
[ __ ] robbing the bank
1:35
man damn and you ain't you weren't
1:37

1:39
once and you gave up I just like how it
1:41
was like not even just like art in
1:42
general it was like fanfic specifically
1:44
when it was like people
1:46
kissing there is no monetary gain here
1:49
bro real plagiarist go until H bomber

1:52
saying I like to consider myself an
1:54
actual artist nowadays even getting a
1:56
degree in game art hey good on you sorry
1:57
you had to get it at this point in uh
1:59
art do you think they can like go back
2:01
to their Roots like do you think they
2:02
could just like like redraw by memory
2:04
just because they've traced it so many
2:05
times o I reckon they should find out I
2:07
think they should find out by submitting
2:08
it in a project for college portfolio I
2:12
I feel so much regret and sin over my
2:14
Butch Harman Oracle that's rough buddy
2:16

2:18
ain't much you can do about that that's
2:19
just well I'm glad they let you have a
2:21
job I'll read this one I be a human toe
2:25
before V How wait wait wait I need to
2:28
I'm laughing because I'm nervous I need
2:30
to know the context like how did this
2:32
was it on accident was it on purpose
2:34
where was this so was it your own did
2:36
the person you took it off of were they
2:37
alive okay but like is this like you
2:40
actually ingested or is it in the same
2:42
way that someone's like oh go eat a dick
2:44
like did you go eat a toe like
2:46
statistically speaking at least one
2:48
person in like thousands who have seen
2:50
anything I've ever done has eaten a
2:52
human body part does eating does biting
2:53
your nails and eating kind of the body
2:55
part um do you swallow them some people
2:57
do uh when I was seven I took a huge C
2:59
crush on Mikey from Teenage mja Turtles
3:02
2012 and I would actually pray for Rene
3:05
is that her name or the goth witch's
3:07
downfall dude I feel that yeah it's just
3:09
like that's you don't even need to be
3:10
anonymous for that one I think you get a
3:11
lot of sympathy off of that oh yeah for

8:06
lot of slip on so you're good oh yeah
8:08
yeah yeah there's there's like ways to
8:09
live in your position for me this is
8:11
like how it was at wecon when I had

those Nails cuz I didn't have nails
8:14
before and trying to learn how to do
8:15

8:23
look good though awesome though thank
8:25
you but um I I'm definitely getting
8:26
shorter ones next time uh I used to work
8:28
at Five Guys one time while wrapping
8:30
Burgers I accidentally slid a fully
8:33
finished WRA Burger straight into a
8:35
trash can I told my manager and he just
8:37
said just put it in the bag and don't
8:39
tell anyone so I
8:42
did I I had like a the only real job
8:45
I've ever had being a YouTuber doesn't
8:46
count was like [ __ ] working at a fast
8:48
food place and some of the [ __ ] you will
8:49
see there put you off from that like
8:51
whatever location you worked at Forever
8:53
maybe the whole chain like it'll ruin it
8:55
so P CH and if it was wrapped it's fine
8:57
if you're the restaurant no no it's not
9:00
fine but for me if like leave something
9:02
wrapped and then toss it out and you're
9:03
like a few hours later you want to read
9:04
you still want to eat it I think you can
9:05
pull it out the trash can can I tell a
9:07
story about basil so there was a time
9:10
where he threw out chicken nuggets okay
9:13
and then took the trash out to the
9:15
dumpster and then he got hungry 2 hours
9:18
later and then went into the dumpster
9:19
and grabbed them and then ate them that
9:21
dude is too [ __ ] similar to his like
9:24
model like he actually how you imagine
9:26
that I was cheating on my terrible
9:28
girlfriend with a F boy told her he was
9:30
one of the boys me and my me and my
9:32
girlfriend were playing fortnite before
9:34
he came over to my house so I was giving
9:35
call outs to my girlfriend while he was
9:37
giving me head and I moaned he's one
9:40
shot he's one shot into my mic before
9:43
climax you are a [ __ ] G for that dude
9:46
that's
9:48
hardcore I mean like if if she was
9:50
shitty probably should have broken up
9:51
with her first but like I'm just saying
9:53
like dudes know how to get better top
9:55
[ __ ] bu got in her deck suck a bunch
9:56
like I'm sure like she would know the
9:57
difference yeah I would reminds me of a
10:00
friend of mine I tell this story all the
10:01
time he lost his virginity to the Black
10:03
Ops 2 multiplayer menu music so whenever
10:06
I play that [ __ ] like I just imag I like
10:09
to imagine like he's just like whenever
10:10
he smiles the good times he's
10:12
remembering are not like playing party
10:13
games with Xbox like his friends just
10:16
cheering your friend on like you should
10:17
just like making your ringtone so
10:19
anytime you guys are like hanging out
10:20
and someone calls you it just goes off
10:22
I'm going to make that his ringtone
10:23
specifically I have over 3K hours in
10:25
Sims 4 and during a lot of them I would
10:27
take my exes and make them into Sims and
10:30
brutally kill them over and over again
10:31
who doesn't do that decent Outlet better
10:33
than beating them to death in real life
10:34
probably should you read the next
10:39
one got done hooking up with a guy he
10:42
blls out comes in his hands and then
10:44
slaps me in
10:46
the I mean you remember it so that's
10:48
good I guess oh man that's a once in a
10:50
lifetime experience worse than like any
10:52
of the this dude just nutted me and
10:54
started playing Animal Crossing like any
10:56
of those dude if this happened I'd be
10:57
pissed off at the moment but like a year
10:59
I'd be like that was like a thing that
11:01
happened I would tell that story all the
11:02
time yeah like it's like the thing bits
11:05
this good don't come around very often
11:07
so you got to make you got to get your
11:08
mileage out of them you know yeah he
11:09
didn't come around either he came
11:11
straight for it too like we got Straight
11:14
Shooters good once I was on Omegle with
11:16

11:18

ending we cussed them out I [ __ ] in the
12:50
sink and I was still a little bit sick
12:53
so I threw up on the floor we left and
12:55

12:59
[ __ ] sink and threw up on the ground

exactly a niche pick I put my sister's
13:15
toothbrush in the toilet because she
13:17
pissed me off never told her I still do
13:19
it sometimes though oh Still Still this
13:21
an active situation Jesus this ain't a
13:23
confession bro this is a life update I
13:25
used to eat food that would be left out
13:27
for hours if it still looked good enough
13:28
to consider assume I feel like I think a
13:31
hangover is a good enough motivator for
13:33
a lot of people to do this oh yeah like
13:35
you have like McDonald's the night and
13:37
then it's like on the counter and you
13:38
like wake up hung over you're like I'm
13:39
[ __ ] eat that need I've always wanted
13:41
to eat Pono the fish from that one
13:43
Studio gibl Movie food looks so good and
13:47
everyone I tell them that to gives me a
13:49
weird look and I have to explain it's
13:50
the fish version not the child I've lost
13:52
too many friends this way several stop
13:54
stop stop bringing it
13:56
up you know you part of an you know you
13:59
can like there's this like cool thing
14:01
you can do whye yeah why is the urge so
14:03
strong you're like I have to eat that
14:05
fish I have to I low key used to eat my
14:08
dog's rawh High bones and chew on my
14:11
blinds and blame it on my dog e okay the
14:14
blinds don't bother me as much as the
14:15
raw High bones that pick me up you know
14:17
they make like stem toys for chewing you
14:19
can you can yeah nowadays definitely
14:21
yeah like you can get that [ __ ] on
14:22
Amazon two day shipping I just imagine
14:24
just
14:25
like bone like just gnawing noises your
14:28
teeth have to be like filed down they
14:30
are not meant for chewing like that no
14:32
yeah no so I figured out a few months
14:34
back that I got autism so I went to my
14:36
mom about it and she was like yeah I
14:37
know she works with special kids needs
14:39
kids so I let it slide then I went to
14:41
work through recommendations and I was
14:42
like I probably didn't mention but I got
14:44
autism and they were like yeah we
14:46
know and like [ __ ] man I'm 22 how did
14:49
everyone else know I'm autistic before I
14:51
did Why did no one tell me that's so
14:55
funny I feel like that happens I feel
14:57
like that happens all the time though
14:59
like all the time yeah yeah I've been
15:01
told that
15:03
before I've been told I don't know I
15:05
feel like especially like in we don't
15:07
talk a lot about it but especially in
15:08
women like cuz people do a lot of like
15:12
male uh testing for like autism and
15:14
stuff like that a lot of women go
15:15
undiagnosed for a very long time and
15:17
then when people bring it up it's like
15:19
they're like oh yeah I figured and
15:20
you're like okay well you didn't say
15:22
anything did you see this year they
15:24
figured out what ovaries actually looked
15:26
like this year this year this year bro
15:29
oh my isn't that [ __ ] up that's
15:32
comical [ __ ] up no one ever looked at
15:34
the over no to look I thought they were
15:36
just balls but inside
15:39
out [ __ ] up yeah I mean I got to see
15:42
what mine look like too so yeah you
15:43
should probably get check one time in
15:45
high school a whole thing spread through
15:48
the school quickly that someone had
15:50
smeared literal [ __ ] on the junior high
15:53
bathroom walls nobody every nobody every
15:56
[ __ ] found ever [ __ ] found out who
15:59
did it American public high school sure
16:02
is something anyways a few years later I
16:04
was talking about high school with uh
16:06
with my brother and then the topic went
16:09
to the person who smeared the [ __ ] on
16:10
the junior high bathroom walls and he
16:13
[ __ ] told me that it wasn't [ __ ] it
16:16
was one of those giant Hershey kisses
16:18
and water and and it turned out it was
16:22
him who smeared it on the [ __ ] wall
16:24
honestly that's that's a great senior
16:26
prank yeah there you go got him no
16:28
actual biohazards and but like you start
16:30
some talk this wasn't a prank but in six
16:33
I think I was in seventh grade but like
16:34
somebody had started a trash can fire
16:36
the sixth grade bathroom a fire that's
16:38
really dangerous I remember I I also
16:40
walked by a class um like as it happened
16:43
I just heard some commotion in the
16:44
classro like this kid storming out and
16:46
the teacher like had just duck down just
16:48
in time cuz apparently the kid threw a
16:50
printer at her oh my God a printer are
16:51
we we still talking sixth grade there's
16:54
dude there are some big like middle
16:56
schoolers what's happening they start
16:58
recrui young for the NFL these days okay
17:00
the first line of this one is forgive me
17:02
quite for I have sinned a couple of
17:03
years ago my phone battery caught on
17:05
fire and when I noticed it was smoking I
17:07
kicked it into my sister's room's
17:09
doorway then it exploded luckily she
17:11
wasn't in there but I still feel guilty
17:13
this was a long time ago like 4 or five
17:15
years threw a firebomb into your
17:17
sister's room I hope you knew she wasn't
17:19
in there oh my God have you seen that
17:21
video of the guy at the workout gym and
17:23
he like drops his weight on his phone
17:24
and explodes what this one honestly I
17:25
don't think it's that bad depending on
17:27
if they knew the sister was in the room
17:28
cuz if you see your phone smoking like
17:30
and you kick it somewhere you know
17:32
nobody is like fair enough bro like
17:34
[ __ ] I used to mix the fountain
17:36
drinks at McDonald's together I still do
17:37
that how dare you I traded my rainbow
17:39
Charizard Pok√©mon card away in first
17:41
grade traded it for a beof because I was
17:43
a meme addict bro you could you could
17:46
have been like paying for your college
17:48
tuition right now I once watched Italia
17:50
with two of my online friends and
17:52
unironically enjoyed it I'm not sure I
17:53
can live with myself anymore yeah you
17:55
you you should be glad this is anonymous
17:58
we are not nice to Talia viewers here oh
18:01
no it's like me looking up because I
18:03
don't know what that is yeah one time
18:06
while on a date with my ex-boyfriend we
18:08
started getting steamy in the car
18:10
leading to me losing my virginity in a
18:12
Home Depot parking lot chosen since it
18:14
wasn't busy at the time my dad's truck
18:16
pulled up beside us while my legs were
18:18
swinging on his shoulders and he made
18:21
direct eye contact with me I moved out a
18:24
month after and now years down the line
18:26
we've never brought it up once your
18:27
dad's real for that I'm not going to lie
18:29
just like let it like I don't want to
18:30
talk about it I [ __ ] that's awful
18:33
when I was in ninth grade I was very
18:34
obsessed with mha what is it I DET track
18:37
these kind of people what am I saying
18:38
brought up a six foot cardboard cutout
18:40
of bakugo to school and insisted he was
18:42
my boyfriend brought that's a [ __ ] that
18:44
they they make fun of when you're like
18:45
oh yeah your girlfriend in Australia is
18:47

18:50
real he brought it in I I'm I'm going to
18:52
be honest all the confessions I've seen
18:54
mha Rel to this are the best evidence
18:56
I've seen for the stereotypes about mha
18:58
fandom being last year I was hooking up
19:00
with a guy who had the same name as my
19:02
dad bear in mind my first language isn't
19:04
English but we [ __ ] in English so I
19:06
could call him daddy I could not make
19:08
this [ __ ] up anyway he ghosted me out of

the blue probably for the best I
19:13
think I I hope you didn't tell him that
19:15
