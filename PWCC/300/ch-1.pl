PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
Task 300-1: Beautiful Arrangements
Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar
Description re-written by Robbie Hatley for clarity:
Given a positive integer n, write a script to return the number
of "beautiful arrangements" within the set of permutations of the
sequence (1..n). A 1-indexed permutation of (1..n) is considered
"a beautiful arrangement" if for every i (1 <= i <= n) either of
the following is true:
1) perm[i] is divisible by i
2) i is divisible by perm[i]

Example #1:
Input: $n = 2
Output: 2
1st arrangement: [1, 2]
perm[1] is divisible by i = 1
perm[2] is divisible by i = 2
2nd arrangement: [2, 1]
perm[1] is divisible by i = 1
i=2 is divisible by perm[2] = 1

Example #2:
Input: $n = 1
Output: 1

Example #3:
Input: $n = 10
Output: 700

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM NOTES:
Other than the hassle of having to generate all of the permutations of (1..n), then counting how many of them
are "beautiful arrangements", this is conceptually straightforward, if a bit complex (O(n!)). One snag is the
requirement for "1-indexed", but I'll handle that by just unshifting the string "dummy" to the left end of
every permutation. And to generate the permutations, I'll use the non-OOP "permute" function from CPAN module
"Math::Combinatorics".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IO NOTES:
Input is via either built-in variables or via @ARGV. If using @ARGV, provide one argument which must be a
single-quoted array of postive integers in the interval [1,10], in proper Perl syntax, like so:
./ch-1.pl '(2,4,6,8)'

Output is to STDOUT and will be each input followed by the corresponding output.
