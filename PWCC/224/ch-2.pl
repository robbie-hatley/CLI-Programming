PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
Task 2: Additive Number
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
You are given a string containing digits 0-9 only. Write a script to find out if the given string is an
"additive number". An "additive number" is a string whose digits can form an "additive sequence".
An "additive sequence" is a sequence (finite or infinite) of integers, containing at least 3 numbers, such
that except the first 2 numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence is the sum of the preceding two.

Example 1:  Input: $string = "112358"  Output: true
The additive sequence can be created using the given string digits: 1,1,2,3,5,8
1 + 1 => 2
1 + 2 => 3
2 + 3 => 5
3 + 5 => 8

Example 2:  Input: $string = "12345"  Output: false
No additive sequence can be created using the given string digits.

Example 3:  Input: $string = "199100199"  Output: true
The additive sequence can be created using the given string digits: 1,99,100,199
 1 +  99 => 100
99 + 100 => 199

PROBLEM NOTES:
This is a "partitions of a string" problem. String partitions are collections of substrings which are
non-duplicating (injective), non-gapping (surjective), non-crossing, and non-overlapping.

String partitions are tantalizingly close to being "non-crossing partitions", given by Catalan numbers,
but are not quite the same thing, as "non-crossing" partitions can overlap, whereas string partitions can't.

Given a string of length n, each "part" of one of its partitions is a substring determined by its
starting and one-past-end indices. The possible "one-past-end" indices are (1..n). 0 can't be a one-past-end
because no strings start before 0, and no empty parts are allowed. And n will ALWAYS be the one-past-end for
the last part (which may also be the first and only part). So the only one-past-end indices which are
"in question" are (1..n-1). Therefore, the total number of possible partitions is the number of subsets of
(1..n-1), which is 2^(n-1).

This suggests an algorithm that bypasses recursion and bypasses CPAN, and is determined only by the 2^(n-1)
possible sets of one-past-end indices described by the following binary-number signatures:
my @signatures=(0..2**($n-1)-1);
Algorithm:
For each such signature, form a partition using those one-past-end indices, and see if that partition is
additive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IO NOTES:
Input is via either built-in variables or via @ARGV. If using @ARGV, provide one argument which must be a
single-quoted array of non-negative integers in proper Perl syntax, like so:
./ch-2.pl '("frog", 13096, 8311, 471118294776123, 2533836361018, 2533836361019, 2533836361020)'

Output is to STDOUT and will be each input number, followed by "IS additive" or "ISN'T additive".
