All 3 conversions have the same range:
in exponential:  (-2^63, +2^63-1) 
in decimal:      (-9223372036854775808, +9223372036854775807)
in E notation:   (-9.223372036854775808E18, +9.223372036854775807E18)
in first approx: (-9.22 quintillion, +9.22 quintillion)
This corresponds to 64-bit signed 2's compliment long-long.

This program also tests use of arbitrary section headers in POD.
