I did that once. Back in 1973 when I was attending Orange Coast College,
Costa Mesa, California, taking computer science classes, I'd just
written a lengthy program in Fortran. The sysop of our dual IBM 370
computers comes strolling through the room where the card punches, 
card reader, and line printer were located, and found me sitting in front 
of a card punch machine, crying. He stopped, and ask concernedly, 
"What's wrong, son?"  I answered, "I dropped my deck" and held up a thick 
deck of now-thoroughly-shuffled punched cards.  He nodded compassionately, 
gave me a pat on the back, and said "I feel you pain". Took me a long time 
to match up each card to the correct line number and get the deck back in 
order.

Those were the days.

And to think that this $600 Asus notebook probably has more computing
power than both of those IBM 370s combined. And they probably cost
the college about $2000000.
