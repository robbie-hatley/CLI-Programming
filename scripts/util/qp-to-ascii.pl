# qp-to-ascii.pl
# Converts all *.eml files in current directoy from "quoted printable" to
# ASCII (and maybe also to Unicode?).
#
# Edit history:
# Thu Jan 01, 2015: Wrote it. (Date is approximate.)
# Fri Jul 17, 2015: Upgraded for utf8.
# Sat Apr 16, 2016: Now using -CSDA.
# Sat Nov 20, 2021: Refreshed shebang, colophon, titlecard, and boilerplate; using "common::sense" and "Sys::Binmode".
# Tue Nov 30, 2021: Fixed list-context bug in FILE loop (added "scalar" to force scalar context).

      {
         # If this line starts with 'PPID' do not print this line and exit 
         # LINE loop here, because the first line marked 'PPID' is the first
         # line of the lengthy HTML gibberish section which comes after the
         # legible "plain text" section:
         last LINE if 'PPID' eq substr($_, 0, 4);

         # Otherwise, decode from quoted-printable to ASCII. 
         # 
         # Note that I'm purposely mis-using decode_qp() here. Normally, it converts 
         # each " =\x0d\x0a" at line ends into a single space, so that the lines of 
         # each paragraph are merged into one paragraph with one "\x0d\x0a" at the end.
         # 
         # But the emails I'm printing already have lines chopped to just the length 
         # I like, so I'm retaining "one CRLF per line" instead of going over to 
         # "one CRLF per paragraph". So to purposely sabotage decode_qp() from merging 
         # lines, I chomp-off the \x0d\x0a at the ends of all lines (see "INITAL GLOBAL
         # ACTIONS section above). 
         # 
         # This does necessitate manually getting rid of the " =" at the ends of lines, 
         # but that is easily accomplished:

         $_ = decode_qp($_); # Decode quoted-printable to ASCII.
         s/ =$//g;           # Get rid of " =" line endings.

      }

      # Strip all leading and trailing whitespace from current line. 
      # (If line consists only of whitespace, line will now become ''.)
      s/^\s+//g; # strip all leading  whitespace
      s/\s+$//g; # strip all trailing whitespace
