This folder ("/rhe/scripts/util") is for utility programs written in
interpretive languages such as Sed, Awk, Perl, Python, Bash, etc, and
intended to be run via BASH, OTHER THAN "filter" programs (programs which
input from STDIN and output to STDOUT rather than acting on files or folders).

Put filters in "/d/rhe/scripts/filters" instead.

Put compiled binary executables in "/rhe2/bin_[cyg|dos|lin]".

Put source code written in compiled languages in subdirectories of "/d/rhe/src".
