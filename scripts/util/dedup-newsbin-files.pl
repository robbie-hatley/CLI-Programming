# "DeDup Newsbin Files"
# Gets rid of duplicate files within file name groups having same base name but different "numerators", where
# a "numerator" is a substring of the form "-(3856)" at the end of the prefix of a file name, and where a
# "base" is a name as it would be if it had no numerators. For example, the "base" of file name
# "Fred-(8874).jpg" is "Fred.jpg".
# Edit history:
# Mon Jun 08, 2015: Wrote it.
# Fri Jul 17, 2015: Upgraded for utf8.
# Sat Apr 16, 2016: Now using -CSDA.
# Wed Feb 17, 2021: Refactored to use the new GetFiles(), which now requires a fully-qualified directory as
#                   its first argument, target as second, and regexp (instead of wildcard) as third.
# Tue Jul 13, 2021: Now 120 characters wide.
# Sat Jul 31, 2021: Now using "use Sys::Binmode" and "e".
# Wed Nov 16, 2021: Now using "use common::sense;".
# Sat Nov 20, 2021: Refreshed shebang, colophon, titlecard, and boilerplate.
# Tue Mar 14, 2023: Added options for local, recursive, quiet, and verbose.
# Thu Aug 03, 2023: Upgraded from "use v5.32;" to "use v5.36;". Got rid of "common::sense" (antiquated).
#                   Went from "cwd_utf8" to "d getcwd". Got rid of prototypes. Changed defaults from "verbose"
#                   and "recurse" to "quiet" and "local". Reduced width from 120 to 110. Shortened sub names.
#                   Got rid of "-l", "--local", "-q", and "--quiet" options as they're already default.
#                   Improved help.
# Mon Aug 21, 2023: An "option" is now "one or two hyphens followed by 1-or-more word characters".
#                   Reformatted debug printing of opts and args to ("word1", "word2", "word3") style.
#                   Inserted text into help explaining the use of "--" as "end of options" marker.
# Tue Aug 22, 2023: Added options for quiet, terse, and local, to complement verbose and recurse.
#                   Added missing sub "error". (What the heck happened to THAT??? It got erased somehow.)
#                   Fixed missing $" and $, variables (set item separation to ', ').
# Mon Aug 28, 2023: Clarified sub argv().
#                   Got rid of "/...|.../" in favor of "/.../ || /.../" (speeds-up program).
#                   Simplified way in which options and arguments are printed if debugging.
#                   Removed "$" = ', '" and "$, = ', '". Got rid of "/o" from all instances of qr().
#                   Changed all "$db" to $Db". Debugging now simulates renames instead of exiting in main.
#                   Removed "no debug" option as that's already default in all of my programs.
#                   Changed short option for debugging from "-e" to "-d".

   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Introduction:

   Welcome to "dedup-newsbin-files.pl", Robbie Hatley's nifty program for
   erasing duplicate files within groups of files having the same base name but
   different "numerators", where a "numerator" is a substring of the form
   "-(####)" (where the "####" are any 4 digits) immediately before the
   filename's extension (the rightmost dot and all characters to its right).

   For example, say you had files named "Frank.txt", "Frank-(3956).txt", and
   "Frank-(1987).txt", and say that "Frank-(3956).txt" is an older duplicate of
   "Frank.txt", but "Frank-(1987).txt" differs in content from the other two.
   Then dnf would erase "Frank.txt" because it's a newer duplicate, and leave
   the other two files intact because they differ in content.

   By default, this program only processes the current working directory, but
   if a "-r" or "--recurse" option is used, it also processes all
   subdirectories of the current working directory as well.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Command lines:

   dedup-newsbin-files.pl [-h|--help]     (to print this help and exit)
   dedup-newsbin-files.pl [options]       (to erase duplicates)

   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Description of options:

   Option:             Meaning:
   -h or --help        Print help and exit.
   -d or --debug       Print diagnostics and simulate renames.
   -q or --quiet       Don't print variables, time, or stats.
   -t or --terse       Print variables and time but not stats.
   -v or --verbose     Print variables, time, and stats.       (DEFAULT)
   -l or --local       DON'T recurse subdirectories.           (DEFAULT)
   -r or --recurse     DO    recurse subdirectories.
         --            End of options (all further CL items are arguments).



   Multiple single-letter options may be piled-up after a single hyphen.
   For example, use -vr to verbosely and recursively process items.

   If multiple conflicting separate options are given, later overrides earlier.
   If multiple conflicting single-letter options are piled after a single hyphen,
   the result is determined by this descending order of precedence: hdnrlvtq.

   If you want to use an argument that looks like an option (say, you want to
   search for files which contain "--recurse" as part of their name), use a "--"
   option; that will force all command-line entries to its right to be considered
   "arguments" rather than "options".

   All options not listed above are ignored.

   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Description of arguments:

   In addition to the options above, this program can take one optional argument,
   which, if present, must be a Perl-Compliant Regular Expression specifying which
   regular-file groups to dedup. To specify multiple patterns, use the "|"
   alternation operator. To apply pattern modifier letters, use an Extended
   RegExp Sequence. For example, if you want to dedup file groups with names
   containing "cat", "dog", or "horse", title-cased or not, recursively:
   dedup-newsbin-files -vr '(?i:c)at|(?i:d)og|(?i:h)orse'
   Be sure to enclose your regexp in 'single quotes', else BASH may replace it
   with matching names of entities in the current directory and send THOSE to
   this program, whereas this program needs the raw regexp instead.

   Happy duplicate file removing!
   Cheers,
   Robbie Hatley,
   programmer.
