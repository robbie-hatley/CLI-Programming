# "DeDup Newsbin Files"
# Gets rid of duplicate files within file name groups having same base name but different numerators. (By "numerator",
# I mean a substring of the form "-(3856)" at the end of the prefix of a file name. By "base", I mean the name as it
# would be if it had no numerators; for example, the "base" of file name "Fred-(8874).jpg" is "Fred.jpg".)
# Edit history:
# Mon Jun 08, 2015: Wrote it.
# Fri Jul 17, 2015: Upgraded for utf8.
# Sat Apr 16, 2016: Now using -CSDA.
# Wed Feb 17, 2021: Refactored to use the new GetFiles(), which now requires a fully-qualified directory as
#                   its first argument, target as second, and regexp (instead of wildcard) as third.
# Tue Jul 13, 2021: Now 120 characters wide.
# Sat Jul 31, 2021: Now using "use Sys::Binmode" and "e".
# Wed Nov 16, 2021: Now using "use common::sense;".
# Sat Nov 20, 2021: Refreshed shebang, colophon, titlecard, and boilerplate.
# Tue Mar 14, 2023: Added options for local, recursive, quiet, and verbose.

   Welcome to "dedup-newsbin-files.pl", Robbie Hatley's nifty program for
   erasing duplicate files within groups of files having the same base name but
   different "numerators", where a "numerator" is a substring of the form
   "-(####)" (where the "####" are any 4 digits) immediately before the
   filename's extension (the rightmost dot and all characters to its right).

   For example, say you had files named "Frank.txt", "Frank-(3956).txt", and
   "Frank-(1987).txt", and say that "Frank-(3956).txt" is an older duplicate of
   "Frank.txt", but "Frank-(1987).txt" differs in content from the other two.
   Then dnf would erase "Frank.txt" because it's a newer duplicate, and leave
   the other two files intact because they differ in content.

   By default, this program only processes the current working directory, but
   if a "-r" or "--recurse" option is used, it also processes all
   subdirectories of the current working directory as well.

   Command lines:
   dedup-newsbin-files.pl [-h|--help]     (to print this help and exit)
   dedup-newsbin-files.pl [-r|--recurse]  (to erase duplicates)

   Description of options:
   Option:              Meaning:
   "-h" or "--help"     Print this help and exit.
   "-l" or "--local"    Don't recurse subdirectories.  
   "-r" or "--recurse"  Recurse subdirectories.        (DEFAULT)
   "-q" or "--quiet"    Be quiet.
   "-v" or "--verbose"  Be verbose.                    (DEFAULT)

   Description of arguments:
   This program ignores all arguments except for the two options mentioned 
   above.

   Happy duplicate file removing!
   Cheers,
   Robbie Hatley,
   programmer.
