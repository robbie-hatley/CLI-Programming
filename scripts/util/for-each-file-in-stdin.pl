   Welcome to "for-each-file-in-stdin.pl", Robbie Hatley's nifty program for
   applying a command (given as the only command-line argument) to each file path
   given by a list of file paths fed into this program via stdin.

   Command lines:

   1. To print this help and exit:
      for-each-file-in-stdin.pl [-h|--help]

   2. To apply Command to file paths given by a "generator" program:
      generator | for-each-file-in-stdin.pl Command
      (where "generator" is a command that generates a list of file paths)

   3. To apply Command to file paths from an existing list:
      for-each-file-in-stdin.pl Command < pathlist
      (where "pathlist" is a file containing file paths, one-per-line)

   Description of options:
   Option:             Meaning:
   "-h" or "--help"    Print this help and exit.

   Description of argument:
   Unless just asking for help, "for-each-file-in-stdin.pl" takes exactly 1
   argument, which must be a valid BASH command which does something to a file
   called "FilePath". This command will be executed once for each file path given
   in stdin. For each file path in stdin, the token "FilePath" in the command
   will be set to the path of that file. Be sure to enclose the argument in
   'single quotes' (so that it gets passed verbatim to this program), and be
   sure to enclose the token "FilePath" in "double quotes" (so that file names
   with spaces won't cause errors).

   For example, to print the contents of all files in the current directory,
   you could type this:

      ls -1 | for-each-file-in-stdin.pl 'cat "FilePath"'

   If the number of arguments is not exactly 1, this program will print an
   error message and abort.

   Also note that this program will malfunction if the command given by the
   argument is not a valid BASH command, so make sure the argument is a valid
   BASH command which does something useful to file "FilePath".

   Cheers,
   Robbie Hatley,
   programmer.
