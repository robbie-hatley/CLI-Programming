# day-of-week.pl
# Prints day-of-week for any day from Jan 1, 1 CE through Dec 31, 9999 CE.
# Input:  Date in YYYY-MM-DD format, as sole command-line argument.
# Output: Date in "Wednesday December 27, 2017" format, to STDOUT.
# Author: Written Tuesday December 23, 2016, by Robbie Hatley.
#
# Edit history:
# Tue Dec 23, 2016: Started  writing it.
# Wed Dec 24, 2016: Finished writing it.
# Sat Apr 16, 2016: Now using -CSDA; also added some comments.
# Sun Jul 23, 2017: Commented-out unnecessary module inclusions and clarified some puzzling comments. Also, converted
#                   from utf8 back to ASCII.
# Wed Dec 27, 2017: Clarified comments.
# Mon Apr 16, 2018: Started work on expanding the date range from 1899-12-31 -> 9999-12-31 to   0001-01-01 -> 9999-12-31
# Wed May 30, 2018: Completed date range expansion.
# Wed Oct 16, 2019: Now gives DOW for both Julian and Gregorian dates.
# Thu Feb 13, 2020: Refactored main() and day_of_week(), implemented emit_despale(), and added "day of week from elapsed
#                   time" feature. (Next up: Gregorian <=> Julian)
# Fri Feb 14, 2020: Cleaned-up some comments.
# Sat Feb 15, 2020: Now gives day of week and both Gregorian and Julian dates for all requests. I also muted warnings
#                   unless user requests them. The minimum date is now Dec 30, 1BCG = Jan 1, 1CEJ, and the maximum date
#                   is now unlimited (though, for dates much past 1000000CEG, the computation time becomes unworkable).
#                   Also, removed "input elapsed time", as it's useless.
# Sat Nov 20, 2021: Refreshed shebang, colophon, titlecard, and boilerplate; using "common::sense" and "Sys::Binmode".

# Although The Gregorian Calendar took effect on Friday October 15, 1582,     #
# The British Empire and it's colonies (including those which later became    #
# USA) didn't adopt The Gregorian calendar until September 14, 1752. Thus     #
# all dates in English-language literature before that date are in            #

# Furthermore, when The British Empire adopted The Gregorian Calendar on      #
# 1752-09-14, the date jumped from September 2, 1752 to September 14, 1752,   #
# thus seemingly slicing 11 days out of history. The dates from Sep 3, 1752   #
# through Sep 13, 1752 thus DO NOT APPEAR IN ENGLISH-LANGUAGE LITERATURE.     #
# Literature written in countries which adopted The Gregorian Calendar in     #
# 1582 does use the Gregorian dates from late-1582 forward. However, such     #
# literature is mostly written in Spanish, French, or Italian rather than     #

   Welcome to Robbie Hatley's nifty "Day Of Week" program. Given a date
   not earlier than January 1 1CE Julian = December 30 1BCE Gregorian,
   this program will tell you what day-of-week (SMTWTFS) that date is.
   The date you give will be assumed to be a Gregorian date unless you
   use a -j or --julian option, in which case it will be assumed to be
   a Julian date.

   Command line:
   day-of-week.pl [-h | --help]
   ...OR...
   day-of-week.pl [-j | --julian] [-w | --warnings] year month day

   If a "-h" or "--help" option is used, then this help message will be printed
   and this application will terminate; any arguments will be ignored.

   Otherwise, this program must be given exactly 3 arguments, which must be
   the year, month, and day for which you want day-of-week. This date must 
   be no earlier than Jan 1 1CE Julian = Dec 30 1BCE Gregorian.
   (To enter either of the last two days of 1BCE Gregorian, use "0000" as year.)

   If a "-j" or "--julian" option is used, the date given will be assumed
   to be Julian; otherwise, it will be assumed to be Gregorian.

   If a "-w" or "--warnings" option is used, this program will warn you when you
   request a Gregorian date for a point in time in which the Gregorian calendar
   was either not in use, or not in use in the English-speaking world. Otherwise,
   no warnings will be given.

   Example 1 (Gregorian):
     input:   day-of-week.pl 1954 7 3
     output:  Gregorian = Saturday July 3, 1954CEG
              Julian    = Saturday June 20, 1954CEJ

   Example 2 (Julian):
     input:   day-of-week.pl -j 874 5 8
     output:  Gregorian = Saturday May 12, 874CEG
              Julian    = Saturday May 8, 874CEJ

   Cheers,
   Robbie Hatley,
   programmer.
