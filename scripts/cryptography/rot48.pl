   Welcome to "Rot48", an unbreakable cipher by Robbie Hatley.

   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   ARGUMENTS, INPUT, AND OUTPUT:

   Rot48 takes one or two arguments.

   The first  argument ($ARGV[0]) must be the path to a pad file.
   (See "NOTES" and "PADS" sections below for more info on pad files.)

   The second argument ($ARGV[1]), if present, must be the path to a key file.
   (See "NOTES" and "KEYS" sections below for more info on key files.)

   Input  of material to be encoded or decoded is from stdin.

   Output of encoded or decoded material is to stdout.

   Material to be encoded should be ASCII text only. (To encode non-ASCII
   material, use my "Rot128" cipher instead.) Ideally, don't use any
   characters other than the 94 glyphical characters on a standard keyboard,
   plus space ('\x20') and horizontal tab ('\x09'). (Any bytes other than those
   96 will be passed-through unencoded.)

   The ciphertexts produced by this program will be ASCII text, but will be
   unreadible gibberish. Even the word lengths won't be the same, because
   rot48 treats spaces and tabs just like any other characters and encodes
   them to other characters. So there will be very few spaces and very-long
   gibberish "words".

   Also note that because this program is "invertible", running encoded material
   through this program a second time with the same pad and key will decode it
   back to its original form.

   If you keep the total number of characters in the input message less than or
   equal to the number of rows in the pad, this cypher becomes a variant of a
   "one-time pad" and is completely unbreakable, becaude each input character gets
   its own pad line.

   Note that including characters in your plain-text which are not in the
   96-character set used by this program weakens the security of this
   cipher, so it's best to keep such characters to a minimum. It's best to
   not use line breaks at all, or only use them to end paragraphs, and use
   your text editor's "word wrap" setting to read plain and cipher texts which
   use long paragraphs.

   Typical usage:
   rot48.pl 'pad.txt' 'key.txt' < plain.txt > cipher.txt

   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   NOTES ON THE ROT48 CIPHER:

   The Rot48 cipher uses a "pad" of randomly-permuted arrays the 96-character
   character set consisting of the 94 glyphical characters on a standard
   101-key or 104-key keyboard, plus space ('\x20') and horizontal tab ('\x09').
   I'll call this character set "CHARSET" for the remainder of this document.
   In Perl lingo, CHARSET is:
   our @Charset = map chr, (9, 32..126);

   Each random permutation of CHARSET can be thought of as being a circular array,
   with the end attached to the beginning.  Since there are 96 elements, one 
   48-position rotation through this circular array will take us to the far side,
   and another will take us back to where we started. Hence Rot48 is "invertible".

   Rot48 works by comparing each incoming character to one such array. If the 
   character is found in the array, the character 48 positions around the circle
   (ie, the diametracally opposite character) is output; otherwise, the incoming
   character is output unchanged. Hence control characters, white-space 
   characters other than space and tab, and non-ASCII characters will not be 
   encrypted. Hence it is advisible to use almost entirely characters from CHARSET
   in plaintexts to be encrypted to avoid giving an interloper too many clues 
   about the structure of the text.

   Since rotating twice takes us back to the beginning, feeding an encrypted
   message back into the program will DE-crypt the message, yielding the
   original plaintext.  Hence this cipher is symmetrical: the decoding
   program/pad/key is the same as the encoding program/pad/key.

   If the number of bytes in the plaintext is not greater than the number of rows
   in the pad, this cipher is completely unbreakable.  Not even the NSA with all
   their supercomputers can't break this cipher, because the characters are truly
   random, so there is no pattern to lock onto. By trial and error, the ciphertext
   could be deciphered to *ANY* same-length plaintext, with no way to determine
   which was the actual original text.

   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   PADS:

   To provide a separate, unique random permutation of CHARSET for each incoming 
   plaintext character to be encrypted, files called "pads" must be constructed,
   each "pad" consisting of hundreds or thousands of lines of text, each line 
   being a unique random permutation of CHARSET.

   Given a pad of at least 500 lines, a 500-character ciphertext could correspond
   to any of (96!)^500 possible plaintexts, and without the pad which was used to
   encrypt the original plaintext, there is no way of determining which of those
   (96!)^500 plaintexts was intended. (In case you're wondering, (96!)^500 is 
   about (10^150)^500, or about 10^75000, or a 1 followed by 75000 zeros (about
   23 printed pages filled with all 0s).)

   A Rot48 pad differs from a one-time pad in that each 96-character row of the
   pad encodes only one character of the plaintext, whereas with a one-time pad,
   each character of the key encodes one plaintext character. This cipher has at
   least two advantages over one-time pads. Firstly, it is invertible, in that
   running a text through the cipher twice returns the text to its previous state.
   Secondly, it allows for the lines of the pad to be used in orders other than
   0,1,2,3..., by using a "key" which specifies line order. 

   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   KEYS:

   To increase security, this cipher can use the lines of the pad in an order
   given by a "key", which is an ASCII text file containing a sequence of 
   integers, in the range of the 0-indexed pad row indexes, separated by commas. 

   The integers in the key can be in ascending-from-0 order (which is not advised,
   as that would be the same as not using a key at all), or in random order, or a 
   permutation of the pad-row indexes, or some combination of those, or some
   other sequence altogether.

   If a good key is used (such as random or permutation order), even if a third 
   party gains access to the pad, it will be useless to him unless he also has
   the key, because he will not know which pad line is used for which character
   of the ciphertext. He'd be reduced to trying pad lines on characters at random.

   For example, given a 500-character ciphertext which was encrypted using a pad
   with 500 lines and a key of 500 random numbers in the 0-499 range, even if an
   interloper has the correct pad, he would have to try all 500^500 (3x10^1349) 
   possible mappings of pad lines to ciphertext characters. That's far, far more
   astronomical than 1 googol. Even at 1 terraflop, that would take 10^1330 years.
   (The universe is less than 10^10 years old.)

   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   EFFECTS OF PLAINTEXT SIZE BEING GREATER THAN PAD SIZE:

   If the number of characters in the plaintext is more than the size of the pad,
   the lines of the pad are reused, starting back at the beginning of the pad.
   (Or, if a key is used, the pattern of pad lines given by the key is reused
   if the size of the ciphertext is larger than the size of the key.) This allows
   for use of pads and keys which are smaller than the texts being encoded, at the
   cost of sacrificing absolute 100% unbreakability. 

   However, I think that for a would-be cracker to stand a reasonable chance of
   cracking this cipher, the length of the plaintext would have to be MANY TIMES
   GREATER THAN the key size. And even then, he'd need supercomputers, many hours
   of CPU time, and a lot of luck.  And that's assuming he has already read this
   document! If he hasn't, that decreases his odds enormously.
