# File path:    /rhe/scripts/math/graph-equations.pl
# Program name: "Graph Equations"
# Description:  Graphs one or more equations to a bmp file, then opens that
#               bmp file in the OS's default bmp-file viewer.
# Input:   A set of up to 10 equations, written in Perl, as command-line
#          arguments to this program (which simply eval's them).
#          The equations must be written in the format "$y = $x**2+3*$x-2"
#          (that is, they must set $y equal to an expression involving $x).
# Output:  Creates temp file "graph-data.dat" in curr dir, containing
#          coordinate and color data for all points to be graphed. Then,
#          calls "plot-points.exe" (which must actually exist in user's path)
#          which plots the points to a bmp file, the name of which is can be
#          specified as an argument to this program (else it defaults to
#          "graph-pict.bmp"in the current directory).
# Edit history:
#    Fri Apr 22, 2016: Wrote first draft.
#    Fri May 06, 2016: I've gone over to using Getopt::Long to get options;
#                      all arguments are now of the form -xmin=-3.693 ,
#                      rather than a long stream of unlabeled arguments.
#                      Also, all formerly-global variables are now lexical
#                      variables in the main part of the script.
#    Mon Jan 01, 2018: Added a check to reject non-numeric y values.
#    Sun Jan 07, 2018: Described inputs & outputs in comments above.
#    Tue Apr 10, 2018: Improve help and comments; reverted to "use v5.020".

   Welcome to "graph-equations.pl". This program graphs equations to a bmp file,
   provided that the companion program, "plot-points.exe", is installed on your
   system in a location listed in your shell's path

   Typical command line:
   graph-equations.pl --xmin=-2 --xmax=2 --ymin=-2 --ymax=2  \
   --width=1100 --height=800 --bits=8 --comp=1 --bpath=pic.bmp \
   '$y=sin($x)' '$y=cos($x)'

   Command-line arguments are segregated into 2 types:
   1. Options   (Starts with "--".  Example: --xmin=2.365)
   2. Equations (Starts with "$y". Example: $y = 3*$x**2 -7*$x +4)

   The following options are optional, but typically you'll want to specify
   most of these, else this program will use set defaults, which usually
   aren't what you want. The values shown are just examples; substitute any 
   values you want. These can appear in any order.

   --help          # use this as sole argument to get this help
   --xmin=-32.8    # minimum x (left   edge) for graph; default = 0
   --xmax=86.5     # maximum x (right  edge) for graph; default = 6pi
   --ymin=-0.02    # minimum y (bottom edge) for graph; default = -3
   --ymax=3395.7   # maximum y (top    edge) for graph; default = +3
   --width=615     # width    of bitmap (10 to 6007)  ; default = 1200
   --height=205    # height   of bitmap (10 to 6007)  ; default = 600
   --bits=24       # bitcount of bitmap (1,4,8, or 24); default = 8
   --comp=0        # compression of bitmap (0 or 1)   ; default = 1
   --bpath=xyz.bmp # path for bitmap (default is ./graph-pict.bmp)

   After the options, write one to ten equations in Perl setting variable $y
   equal to various expressions in terms of variable $x. Use standard Perl
   operators ( + - * / ) for arithmetic, ** for exponents and roots,
   and sin, cos, tan, cot, sec, csc for trigonometric functions.
   Put all equations in 'single quotes', else your shell may try to interpolate
   or expand them instead of sending them to graph-equations.pl intact.

   graph-equations.pl will then calculate data points, using 100 points per
   pixel width (for continuous graph lines even in areas of high slope),
   and store a data file named "graph-data.dat" in the current directory
   containing those points as (x,y,c) triplets (where c is a color index
   unique to one particular equation). This program will then pass the paths
   of the data file and bmp file to "plot-points.exe", which will plot the
   points from the data file to the bmp file. After "plot-points.exe"
   returns, "graph-equations.pl" will then open the bmp file in
   whatever program is Windows's default program for bmp files.

   NOTE: for the bmp file path, specify a name only, because the path needs
   to be valid in both Windows and BASH, because it's going to be launched in
   a Windows program. This is especially a problem if you're using Cygwin, 
   because Windows doesn't understand "/cygdrive/d/argle/abc.bmp". 
   So insted, manually cd to "/cygdrive/d/argle" in cygwin's BASH, which 
   will put you in Windows folder "D:\argle". Then use "--bpath=abc.bmp", 
   which will write abc.bmp to folder "D:\argle".

   NOTE: You'll probably need to change the "my $command = " line to something
   more suitable for your system, depending on what graphics viewer you want to
   view graphs in.

   Happy equation graphing!
   Cheers,
   Robbie Hatley,
   programmer.
