This folder ("/d/rhe") is my main programming workspace.  It contains source code,
headers, modules, scripts, etc, pertaining to computer programming in various languages,
both compiled and interpreted. As of 2023, I've begun sharing most of this material with
all of humankind via Github, in case anyone may find some of it to be of use.
