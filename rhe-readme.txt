This folder ("/d/rhe" = "D:\rhe") is my main programming workspace.  It contains source code,
headers, libraries, modules, scripts, notes, etc, pertaining to computer programming in
various languages, both compiled and interpreted. As of 2023, I've begun sharing most of
this material with all of humankind via Github, in case anyone may find some of it to be
of use.
